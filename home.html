            Although computer programming is more integrated in society than it ever has been before, the public educational system has not been able to supply these relevant computer programming courses at the elementary and high school levels. 
            <br>
            This new camp, run by ambitious UBC students, aims to introduce the concepts programming to students in grades 8 – 12 using Java.

                Final Project - Connect Four
            </div>
            <p>
                By the end of the course, students will be able to create a command line Connect Four game based on concepts they learn in class. This simple program will teach the basics of software development, algorithms, and design patterns.
                <br>
                Try out a sample of the command line version of the game below!
